# Final Project: Personal Budget Tracker

Welcome to my Personal Budget Tracker project, a Python application designed to help users track and categorize their monthly expenses, and assist in budgeting effectively.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Python app that allows users to input their expense details (name, category, amount) directly into the terminal. The app will then save these entries to a CSV file, summarize the expense totals for the month, and provide users with information on how much they can spend for the remainder of the month to stay within their budget.

### ðŸš€ Project Requirements

1. Enable users to add expenses (name, category, amount).
2. Save expense entries to a CSV file.
3. Read the file to calculate and display the total expenses for the current month.
4. Provide users with information on remaining budget for the month.

#### âœ¨ Bonus Features

1. Display expenses categorized by category.
2. Offer users an estimate of their daily spending limit.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Structure

The project will consist of two main files:

1. `expense.py`: A Python class for creating and managing expense objects.
2. `expense_tracker.py`: The primary application file containing the main logic.

## âœ… Tasks

1. Develop the `expense.py` class to handle expense objects.
2. Implement the main logic of the application in `expense_tracker.py`.
3. Test the application to ensure functionality.
